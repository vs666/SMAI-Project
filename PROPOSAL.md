## Problem Statement

## Goals and Approach     

### Data-Driven Approach

#### SMOTE : Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique

This paper shows that a combination of our method of **over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class** can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.       

This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes.

**`DATABASE :`** We plan to use the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains 2 classes and 768 samples. The reason for choosing this was, that it's a medical database and thus, is a realistic scenario where such class imbalances occour. Number of positive class samples is only 268.    


### Algorithm Driven Approach
